<h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>
<p>For this third blog, I chose to write about the shortcut "programming" feature of the latest ios version 14.</p>
<br>

<h1><b>Creating the Shortcut</b></h1>
<p>To create a new shortcut you will first need to navigate to the shortcuts application on your iPhone, it should look something like this:</p>
<br>

<p>Once you have found and selected the Shortcuts application within: <code>My Shortcuts > All Shortcuts</code> you should be able to see a <code>"+"</code> option. Go ahead and click that, once you do you should see the option to <code>+ Add Action</code>. The shortcut we are going to create will prompt us for a "reminder" and a date and time to receive a notification.</p>
<p>To get started, after selecting the <code>+ Add Action</code> button, we first want to be able to prompt the user, to do that we will need to navigate to the <code>Ask For Input</code> scripting option: <code>Scripting > Notification > Ask For Input</code>. This option prompts the user to enter a piece of information.</p>
<p>Once we have selected the <code>Ask For Input</code> option, it will ask for <code>Text</code> and a <code>Prompt</code>. To prompt the user to enter a "reminder" we can leave <code>Text</code> as is, but we want to go ahead and enter a prompt for input into the <code>Prompt</code> section. For Example:</p>

<pre>What would you like to set a reminder for?</pre>

<p>After we have that set, we want to go ahead and put in another <code>Ask For Input</code> scripting option to get the date and time to receive a notification. To do this we can again navigate to <code>Scripting > Notification > Ask For Input</code>, then once we have it set, this time we want to change <code>Text</code> to <code>Date and Time</code> and then we want to go ahead and fill out the <code>Prompt</code> section with a prompt to select a date and time. For Example:</p>

<pre>What date and time would you like to set this reminder?</pre>

<p>After we have entered in both of our prompts, we can now add in the <code>Add New Event</code> function within the Calendar application which will create a new event in our Calendar application. You can use the Reminders application, I just don't like it personally.</p>
<p>To insert the <code>Add New Event</code> function for the Calendar application we can navigate to it by selcting: <code>Apps > Calendar > Add New Event</code>. Once you have the option inserted, it asks for a <code>Title</code>, <code>Tomorrow at noon</code>, and <code>Tomorrow at 1pm</code>. For the <code>Title</code> section, we want to go ahead and select the <code>Select a Magic Variable</code> option and we can now select the <code>Provided Input</code> for the very first prompt, then for the remaining two time slots we can, again using the <code>Select a Magic Variable</code> option, select a <code>Provided Input</code>, but this time for both sections we want to go ahead and select the <code>Provided Input</code> for the second prompt.</p>
<p>After selecting the variables, we want to open up the <code>Show More</code> section below and then select an <code>Alert</code> option. I chose the <code>At time of event</code> option.</p>
<p>Once you have completed these steps you should have some thing that looks like this:</p>
<br>

<p>Once you have your Shortcut setup, we can now test it out by selecting the tiny play button in the bottom right corner. Once started, you will see these prompts:</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="column">
   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeumasMymik/LeumasMymik.github.io/master/docs/myPics/reminderPrompt.PNG" style="width:100%">
</div>
<div class="column">
   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeumasMymik/LeumasMymik.github.io/master/docs/myPics/datetimePrompt.PNG" style="width:100%">
</div>
</div>

<p>This Shortcut simply creates a new event using the Calendar application. I use it like a reminder because I prefer the notification that I receive from the event, but again this is just personal preference.</p>
<br>

<h1><b>Conclusion</b></h1>
<p>I think there are a lot of more useful uses for this new Shortcuts feature that Apple implemented within the ios 14 update, and I am very excited to explore more of the capabilities this feature provides. I thought it was really interesting having a sort of drag and drop "programming" experience on an iPhone of all things. Overall, I think it was a very educational experience.</p>
