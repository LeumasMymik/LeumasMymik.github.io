<h1><b>How to Generate a Personal Access Token on GitHub</b></h1>
<p>This blog will document the steps for generating a personal access token within GitHub as the method of entering your username and password will become depreciated and no longer used in August 2021.</p>
<br>

<h1><b>Steps:</b></h1>
<p>The first thing that we need to do is log into github on the browser of your choosing and once you are logged in you should be able to click on your profile icon to see a drop down list of options.</p>
<p>The option that we are interested in is the one titled <code>Settings</code>. It should look something like this:</p>

</center>
<br>

<p>Once you have selected <code>Settings</code> on your left hand side you should see an option for <code>Developer Settings</code>, it should look something like this:</p>
<center>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeumasMymik/LeumasMymik.github.io/master/docs/myPics/developersettings.png" alt="Developer Settings">
</center>
<br>

<p>After you have selected <code>Developer Settings</code> you should see the option for <code>Personal Access Tokens</code>.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeumasMymik/LeumasMymik.github.io/master/docs/myPics/personalaccesstokens.png" alt="Personal Access Tokens">
</center>
<br>

<p>Then, after you have selected <code>Personal Access Tokens</code> you should see the option to <code>Generate New Token</code>.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeumasMymik/LeumasMymik.github.io/master/docs/myPics/generatenewtoken.png" alt="Generate New Token">
</center>
<br>

<p>Once you select <code>Generate New Token</code> you should be prompted to enter a descriptive name for your token, along with the available scopes that you can assign to the token. The scopes can be assigned based on your needs or the needs of the user that will be assigned this token.</p>
<p>Once you have finished selecting the scope for your token you can select <code>Generate Token</code> to receive a copy of your token.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that GitHub warns you to keep your tokens safe as if you would a password.</p>
