<p>My name is Samuel Kim, and I am currently a senior at California State University, Northridge. I am working towards getting a bachelors in Computer Information Technology. After my ascendancy to the legal drinking age here in Caliornia, I became the embodiment of the Jinro Frog, Jinro being one of the largest, if not the largest, manufacturer of soju.</p>

<p>This GitHub Blog started off as a way for me to practice documentation through the form of blogs, as I learned new things throughout the course of my Senior Design class I would document them here.</p>

<p>In addition to that, this site has become the dedicated final project for my COMP 484/L course. For this course requirement, I created two additional sites and shifted around existing sites to make the site look better for users and navigate a little bit better than before. Due to other requirements, I thought that it would be interesting to implement a JQuery Terminal feature on the site to cover most if not all of the javascript and array requirements for the project.</p>
